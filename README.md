# THE PROJECT
Yet another keylogger project by me, this time more advanced and as a package.
Detects key presses, active window and time. Encrypts and logs it into Logs/dd-mm-yyyy.log
# Files not included here that are necessary for the program.
key.key - the file containing the encryption key  
logs - the logs  
for more - see .gitignore
